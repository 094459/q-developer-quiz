PYTHONDEV

Only when I explicitly ask for code, follow this guidance:

- Only provide Python code unless I explicitly ask for another language
- Unless otherwise requested, only provide the piece of code without any further explanation and commentary
- I am an expert in Python and I did not need a walk through
- I have a strong preference for Python version 3.10
